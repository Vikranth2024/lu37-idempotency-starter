# Idempotency and Duplicate-Safe Writes

Build duplicate-safe `POST /incidents` endpoint that returns one durable result when same logical request arrives more than once.

## Why This Repository Exists

Current starter inserts incident on every request. It has no idempotency record, duplicate claim, stored replay result, or durable paging job. Supplied tests describe required contract.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- Docker with Docker Compose
- GitHub account

## Setup

1. Fork repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/idempotency-and-duplicate-safe-writes.git
cd idempotency-and-duplicate-safe-writes
git checkout -b idempotent-incidents
```

3. Start PostgreSQL and install dependencies:

```bash
docker compose up -d
npm install
```

4. Reset database and run tests:

```bash
npm run db:reset
npm test
```

Starter tests fail until required schema and handler are implemented. This is expected.

## What to Implement

### Database

Add:

- scoped idempotency record with key, request hash, state, replay metadata, and expiry;
- unique ownership for authenticated tenant + operation + key;
- durable paging-job table.

### Handler

Implement:

- required `Idempotency-Key` validation;
- authenticated tenant scope;
- canonical request hash;
- atomic key claim before incident creation;
- completed replay, changed-request conflict, and processing response;
- one transaction for key, incident, paging job, and completed response.

Do not call external queue/provider inside database transaction.

### README Decisions

Explain:

1. why database uniqueness is needed;
2. how request contents are canonicalized and compared;
3. what 24-hour expiry means;
4. why paging job is stored in same transaction;
5. privacy and size risks of stored responses.

## Test Coverage

Supplied tests check:

- missing key;
- first request;
- sequential replay;
- replay response header;
- changed payload conflict;
- tenant isolation;
- 20 concurrent duplicates;
- exactly one incident and paging job;
- lost response retry;
- processing and failed states;
- transaction rollback;
- canonical hash;
- stored scope and operation.

Do not change tests.

## Submit Pull Request

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement duplicate-safe incident creation"
git push -u origin idempotent-incidents
```

Open pull request from `idempotent-incidents` into your fork's `main` branch. Include:

- summary of approach;
- design decisions;
- passing test output.

Submit pull-request URL, not repository homepage, branch, commit, or PDF link.

## Troubleshooting

**Docker port conflict:** stop process using port 54329 or change port consistently in Compose and `DATABASE_URL`.

**Database connection failed:** wait until PostgreSQL is healthy, then run `npm run db:reset` again.

**Tests say idempotency table is missing:** implement schema TODOs and rerun reset before tests.

**Resetting production data:** never point `DATABASE_URL` at shared or production database. Reset script is destructive.
